# Facial-Expression-Detector-
This script trains and runs a real-time facial emotion detection model. It preprocesses images, builds a CNN, and trains it using TensorFlow. If a model exists, it loads it for live detection via OpenCV, identifying faces and displaying emotions with emojis and confidence levels. Press 'Q' to exit live detection mode.
